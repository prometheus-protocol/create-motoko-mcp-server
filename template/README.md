# My Awesome MCP Server

This project was generated by `create-motoko-mcp-server` and provides a complete, ready-to-deploy Motoko MCP server for the [Prometheus Protocol](https://prometheusprotocol.org) ecosystem.

This guide assumes you are using `npm` as your package manager.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools installed on your system:

1.  **DFX:** The DFINITY Canister SDK. [Installation Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install/).
2.  **Node.js:** Version 18.0 or higher. [Download](https://nodejs.org/).
3.  **MOPS:** The Motoko Package Manager. [Installation Guide](https://mops.one/docs/install).
4.  **Git:** The version control system. [Download](https://git-scm.com/).

## Part 1: Quick Start (Local Development)

This section guides you from zero to a working, testable MCP server on your local machine.

### Step 1: Initialize Your Repository

The Prometheus publishing process is tied to your Git history. Initialize a repository and make your first commit now.

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit from template"
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

This command will install both the required Node.js packages and the Motoko packages.

```bash
npm install
npm run mops:install
```

### Step 3: Deploy Your Server Locally

1.  **Start the Local Replica:** (Skip this if it's already running)
    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
2.  **Deploy to the Local Replica:** (In a new terminal window)
    ```bash
    npm run deploy
    ```

### Step 4: Test with the MCP Inspector

Your server is live and its default `get_weather` tool is ready to use.

1.  **Launch the Inspector:**
    ```bash
    npm run inspector
    ```
2.  **Connect to Your Canister:** Use the local canister ID endpoint provided in the `npm run deploy` output.
    ```
    # Replace `your_canister_id` with the actual ID from the deploy output
    http://127.0.0.1:4943/mcp/?canisterId=your_canister_id
    ```
ðŸŽ‰ **Congratulations!** You have a working local MCP server.

## Part 2: Enable Monetization

Ready to add paid tools? Follow these steps to enable authentication and test with an API key.

### Step 1: Activate Monetization in Code

1.  Open `src/main.mo`.
2.  Uncomment the `payment` block inside the `get_weather` tool definition.
3.  Uncomment the `allowanceUrl` in the `mcpConfig`.
4.  Uncomment the large block of code that initializes the `authContext`.
5.  Save the file and run `npm run deploy` again to update your local canister.

### Step 2: Generate and Test an API Key

With monetization active, your server can issue and validate API keys.

1.  **Generate a Key:** Use `dfx` to call your canister and create a key linked to your developer identity.
    ```bash
    # Replace <your_canister_id> with your local canister ID
    dfx canister call <your_canister_id> create_api_key '("My Test Key")'
    ```
    **Save the returned key!** This is the only time it will be shown.

2.  **Test with MCP Inspector:**
    -   Open the MCP Inspector as before.
    -   In the "Authorization" section, set the `x-api-key` header to the API key you just generated.
    -   Call the `get_weather` tool again. It should now succeed, indicating that your monetization setup is working.
    ```

### Step 3 (Optional): Enable Interactive Login

For user-facing web apps, you can enable the browser-based OAuth login flow.
```bash
npm run auth register
```

## Part 3: Publish to the App Store (Deploy to Mainnet)

Instead of deploying to mainnet yourself, you publish your service to the Prometheus Protocol. The protocol then verifies, audits, and deploys your code for you.

### Step 1: Commit Your Changes

Make sure all your code changes (like enabling monetization) are committed to Git.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: enable monetization"
```

### Step 2: Publish Your Service

Use the `app-store` CLI to submit your service for verification and deployment.

```bash
# 1. Get your commit hash
git rev-parse HEAD
```

```bash
# 2. Run the init command to create your manifest
npm run app-store init 
```

Complete the prompts to set up your `prometheus.yml` manifest file.
Add your commit hash and the path to your WASM file (found in `.dfx/local/canisters/<your_canister_name>/<your_canister_name>.wasm`).

```bash
# 3. Run the publish command with your app version
npm run app-store publish "0.1.0"
```

Once your service passes the audit, the protocol will automatically deploy it and provide you with a mainnet canister ID. You can monitor the status on the **Prometheus Audit Hub**.

## Part 4: Managing Your Live Server

### Treasury Management

Your canister includes built-in Treasury functions to securely manage the funds it collects. You can call these with `dfx` against your **mainnet canister ID**.

-   `get_owner()`
-   `get_treasury_balance(ledger_id)`
-   `withdraw(ledger_id, amount, destination)`

### Updating Your Service (e.g., Enabling the Beacon)

Any code change to a live service requires publishing a new version.

1.  Open `src/main.mo` and uncomment the `beaconContext`.
2.  Commit the change: `git commit -m "feat: enable usage beacon"`.
3.  Re-run the **publishing process** from Part 3 with the new commit hash.
